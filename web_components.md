# Web Components

**Web Components** are a set of new web standards being produced by Google engineers that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in the web. 

Web Components consist of 4 main elements which can be used separately or all together:

* Custom Elements
* Shadow DOM
* HTML Imports
* HTML Templates
