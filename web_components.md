# Web Components

**Web Components** are a set of new web standards being produced by Google engineers that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in web documents and web applications. The intention behind them is to bring component-based software engineering to the World Wide Web. The components model allows for encapsulation and interoperability of individual HTML elements.

Support for Web Components is present in some WebKit-based browsers like Google Chrome and Opera and is in Mozilla Firefox (requires a manual configuration change). Microsoft's Internet Explorer has not implemented any Web Components specifications yet.[1] Backwards compatibility with older browsers is implemented using JavaScript-based polyfills.

Web Components consist of 4 main elements which can be used separately or all together:

Custom Elements
Shadow DOM
HTML Imports
HTML Templates
