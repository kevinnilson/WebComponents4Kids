# Web Components

**Web Components** are a set of new web standards being produced by Google engineers that allow for the creation of reusable widgets or components in the web. 

Web Components consist of 4 main elements which can be used separately or all together:

* Templates
* Shadow DOM
* Custom Elements
* HTML Imports


## Templates

## Shadow DOM





## Custom Elements

Custom Elements = Templates + Shadow DOM.

Without custom elements HTML typically looks like div soup:
![Div Soup](images/div-soup-resized.jpg)

```
<div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
</div>

```

With custom elements your HTML can look much more readable like:
```
<school-class>
  <class-grade></class-grade>
  <class-teacher>
    <teacher-name></teacher-name>
    <teacher-avatar></teacher-avatar>
  </class-teacher>
  <student-list>
      <class-student>
        <student-name></student-name>
        <student-age></student-age>
        <student-avatar></student-avatar>
      </class-student>
  </student-list>
</school-class>
```
