**HTML** pages have 2 parts (head & body).  **Body** is where the content of your page goes.


## Attributes

HTML elements can have one or more attribute.  Each attribute has a value.

```html
<element attribute="value"/>```

The **img** element is how you add images to a webpage.  The **img** tag has a **src** attribute that specifies the image to display.  The image tag also has a **width** and **height** attribute.

```html
<img src="http://webcomponents.org/img/logo.svg" width="104" height="142">```
