There are many tags in HTML you can use to make your website.  In the above example I am showing h1,a,span,div,and button.


The ```<span>``` tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.
```html
<span>this is a span</span>
```

The ```<div>``` tag is also used to group inline-elements in a document.
```
<div style="color:#00ff00">this is a div </div>
```

The main difference is that the span tag is an inline element, whereas the div tag is a block level element.


The ```<h1> to <h6>``` tags are for headings.  
```
<h1>this is a heading</h1>
```

* h1 is the biggest heading
* h2 is a smaller heading
* h6 is a smallest heading


```
<a href="http://www.andynilson.com/" target="_blank">this is a link to my webpage.</a>
```

* in HTML links are defined as anchor tag
* href specifies a link's destination
* The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document
* a linked page is displayed in the current browser window if you do now specify a target
* _blank is a special target name that means always in a new window
     


```<br/>``` this is a line brake

   
The span tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.
The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document and is also used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.
