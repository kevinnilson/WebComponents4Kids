```html
<h1>Learning HTML</h1>
<h1>this is a heading</h1>
    

<a href="http://www.andynilson.com/" target="_blank">this is a link to my webpage.</a>


<br/>

<span>this is a span</span>
<span>this is another span</span>

<br/>

<div style="color:#00ff00">this is a div </div>
<div style="color:#00fff0">this is another div</div>

<button type="button" onclick="alert('you just clicked a button')">Click Me!</button>

 this is how you add a comment in HTML
```
    
The main difference is that the span tag is an inline element, whereas the div tag is a block level element.
* h1 is the biggest heading
* h2 is a smaller heading
* h6 is a smallest heading

* in HTML links are defined as anchor tag
* href specifies a link's destination
* The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document

The span tag is used to group inline-elements in a document.
The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document and is also used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.
