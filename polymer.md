# Polymer

The **Polymer** library is designed to make it easier and faster for developers to create great, reusable components for the modern web.


**Polymer** builds on top of the upcoming web components technologies. Not all browsers support these standards yet, so the [web components **polyfill** library](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/) fills the gaps, implementing the APIs in JavaScript.

The Polymer library. Provides a declarative syntax that makes it simpler to define custom elements. And it adds features like templating, two-way data binding and property observation to help you build powerful, reusable elements with less code.

This is a collection of libraries (or "polyfills") for new web technologies that haven't shipped yet across all browsers. The web components polyfills make it possible for developers to use these standards today across all modern browsers. As these technologies are implemented in browsers, the polyfills will shrink and you'll gain the benefits of native implementations.
