# Polymer

The **Polymer** library is designed to make it easier and faster for developers to create great, reusable components for the modern web.


**Polymer** builds on top of the upcoming web components technologies. Not all browsers support these standards yet, so the [web components **polyfill** library](http://webcomponents.org/polyfills/) fills the gaps, implementing the **API**s in **JavaScript**. As these technologies are implemented in browsers, the polyfills will shrink and you'll gain the benefits of native implementations.
