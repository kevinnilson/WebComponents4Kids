# Polymer

The Polymer library that provides a declarative syntax that makes it simpler to define custom elements.  Polymer adds features like templating, two-way data binding and property observation to help you build powerful, reusable elements with less code.

Polymer builds on top of the upcoming web components technologies, which donâ€™t yet ship in all browsers.

This is a collection of libraries (or "polyfills") for new web technologies that haven't shipped yet across all browsers. The web components polyfills make it possible for developers to use these standards today across all modern browsers. As these technologies are implemented in browsers, the polyfills will shrink and you'll gain the benefits of native implementations.
